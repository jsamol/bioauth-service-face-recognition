### About the BioAuth project

BioAuth is a remote biometric authentication system for mobile devices. The project was developed as part of a Master's thesis at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow.

The BioAuth system is divided into three parts: **Mobile**, **Web** and **Server**:

#### Mobile

The Mobile part consists of a library which can be used to register a new biometric template or authenticate an already signed up user. 

The mobile library is responsible for acquiring a biometrics sample and sending it to the server. It is also able to perform a liveness detection.

Applications using the mobile BioAuth SDK must be registered in the system and assigned unique `AppId` and `AppSecret` keys.

#### Web

The Web part consists of a Mobile App Management Web Application which is used to register and manage mobile applications in the system.

#### Server

The Server part consists of Web and Mobile backends and biometric microservices. 

The Web backend is used for generating new `AppId` and `AppSecret` keys and registering new mobile applications in the database.

The Mobile backend receives biometric samples from the BioAuth mobile library and forwards them to a proper biometric microservice with any required additional data. It is also responsible for saving biometric templates in the database.

The biometric microservices perform a liveness detection, extract features from a biometric sample and compare the sample with saved templates.

## 

The authentication process in BioAuth is inspired by [FIDO protocols](https://fidoalliance.org/).
